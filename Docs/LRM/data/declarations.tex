\section{Declarations and Bindings}

This section of the LRM describes the syntax and informal semantics of
declarations in SMURF. A program in SMURF, at its top-most level, is a
series of declarations. However, declarations may also occur inside of
\texttt{let} expressions. The scoping of such declarations is described 
in this sections. There are three types of declarations in SMURF: 
type signatures, pattern declarations, and function declarations.

\subsection{Type Signatures}

\begin{grammar}

<type-sig> $\rightarrow$ <identifier> :: <type-list>

<type-list> $\rightarrow$ <type> | <type> -$\rangle$ <type-list>

<type> $\rightarrow$ Int | Bool | Note | [<type>] | 
										( <type>, $\vdots$, <type> )
										

\end{grammar}
