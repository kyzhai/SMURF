\section{Syntax Notation}


%TODO
In the syntax notation used in this manual, nonterminals are indicated by italic type, terminals are 
indicated by single quotes. We make frequent use of regular expression notation to specify grammar 
patterns. r* means the pattern r may appear zero or more time, r+ means the r may appear one or more 
times, r? means r may appear zero or once. r1 | r2 denotes an option between two patterns, r1 r2 denotes 
r1 followed by r2.
