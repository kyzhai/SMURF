\section{SMURF Pipeline}

The proposed pipeline for composing music with SMURF is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}. 
The composer creates serial music by first writing a SMURF program, which will be 
compiled by our SMURF compiler to generate a C program with OpenGL. Then the gcc compiler 
and assembler are used to generate a music score with which musicians can play.
