\section{SMURF Pipeline}

The proposed pipeline for composing music with SMURF is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}. 
The composer first creates serialist music with SMURF programming language, which will be 
compiled by our SMURF compiler to generate C program with OpenGL library. Then the gcc compiler 
and assembler are used to generated music score with which musicians can play.
