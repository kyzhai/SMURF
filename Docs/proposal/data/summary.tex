SMURF is a functional language that will allow a composer to create serialist music
based on twelve-tone composition. In general, serialism is a musical composition
technique where a set of values, chosen through some methodical process, generates
a sequence of musical elements. Our languge will be based on the functional syntax
and semantics set forth by Haskell, and we will compile our programs into C.
The C program will then use openGL to generate images of sheet music corresponding to the user's
initial program in SMURF.
